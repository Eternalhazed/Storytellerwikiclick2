Storyteller is a self-hosted platform for creating and reading ebooks with synced narration. It's made of of three components: the API server, the web interface, and the mobile apps. Together, these components allow you to take audiobooks and ebooks that you already own and automatically synchronize them, as well as read or listen to (or both!) the resulting synced books.
