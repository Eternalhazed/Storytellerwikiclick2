Storyteller is a self-hosted platform for creating and reading ebooks with
synced narration. It's made of three components: the API server, the web
interface, and the mobile apps. Together, these components allow you to take
audiobooks and ebooks that you already own and automatically synchronize them,
as well as read or listen to (or both!) the resulting synced books.
