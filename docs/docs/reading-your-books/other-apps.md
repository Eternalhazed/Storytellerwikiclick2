# Other e-reader apps

There are also other ebook reader apps that can display and play the books
produced by Storyteller, because Storyteller produces EPUB 3-compliant ebook
files.

Unfortunately, the Media Overlay specification for EPUB is relatively new, and
has not been implemented by very many e-readers to date. The app
[BookFusion](https://www.bookfusion.com/) has been tested with
Storyteller-produced ebooks, but it has less robust audiobook features than the
[Storyteller mobile apps](/docs/reading-your-books/storyteller-apps), and it can
often fail to find your place correctly in the text after a long listening
session.

To add a Storyteller book to BookFusion, navigate to your Storyteller web
interface on your mobile device and download the book files that you wish to
read. Then open the BookFusion app and click on the blue-and-white "upload"
button in the top right corner. Here, you should be able to select your
downloaded Storyteller book from your Downloads folder.

If anyone finds any apps that have better support for EPUB Media Overlays and
allow users to supply their own book files, please let us know on
[Gitter](/docs/come-chat)!
