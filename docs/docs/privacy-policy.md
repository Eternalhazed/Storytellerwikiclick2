# Privacy policy

The Storyteller team does not collect any data whatsoever about Storyteller
users via the Storyteller platform. None of the three components of the platform
(the API, the admin website, or the mobile applications) collect or transmit
analytics or telemetry.

Individial API instances, which are owned and run by users, store information
about books, collections, and users on those API instances. This data is stored
locally and is only ever transmitted to authorized users of the API instance
making requests through the web or mobile clients.

The mobile applications store book data and reading progress, as well as
securely storing credentials and server locations. This data is stored locally
on the user's device, and is only ever transmitted to Storyteller server
instances that the user has explicitly connected to.

## Bug Reporting & Voluntary User Data Submission

Users can report issues with Storyteller on
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/smoores/storyteller/-/issues) or
[GitHub](https://github.com/smoores-dev/storyteller/issues). Information
submitted on these systems is public, and is subject to GitLab and GitHub's
respective privacy policies.
