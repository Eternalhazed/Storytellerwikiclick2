# Securely Share Your Storyteller Server with Tailscale (Guide for Non- Techies!)
For those of you who want to open your Storyteller Server (StS) up to the internet — and maybe share with family — but want to do so safely, here are some basic instructions for how to do it (these are Mac specific, but should be translatable!)

1. **Create a Tailnet** 
  1. Watch this video and follow these super easy instructions: https://tailscale.com/kb/1017/install
  2. Install Tailscale on the computer where your StS is located.
  3. Install Tailscale on any devices that you want to be able to connect to your StS. (This includes other computers as well as your reading devices.)
2. **Give your Tailnet a cute name** by going to the DNS tab and clicking the Rename Tailnet button. (Optional)
3. **Make your connection secure!** This lets you access your Storyteller Server securely via HTTPS *inside* your Tailnet. (Required for reader app connections.)
  - In Terminal run: tailscale serve --https=443 --bg 8001
  - I had to add: /Applications/Tailscale.app/Contents/MacOS/ to the beginning. It didn’t want to find the CLI otherwise. :/
  - Possible error
    - You may get told :
      '''
    Serve is not enabled on your tailnet.
    To enable, visit:
    https://login.tailscale.com/f/serve?node=...
    '''

    - If so, just paste the link into a brower and follow the instructions. Your terminal window will update with something like this:
      ' Success.
            '''
        Available within your tailnet:
      
      https://storyteller-server.lemur-dragon.ts.net/
     |-- proxy http://127.0.0.1:8001
    
      Serve started and running in the background.
      To disable the proxy, run: tailscale serve --https=443 off
      '''

4. **Re-point all your connections** to the StS inside your Tailnet.
    1. You do not need the :8001 when your connection is secure!
    2. You do need to make sure you have the S in https://
    3. Remember that TailScale must be running on your device in order to resolve the URL. This is true for both the web interface and the Reader app on all devices.

  5. Position syncing and book downloads now **available to you everywhere!**
