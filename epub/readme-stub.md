## About

Throughout this library's documentation, there will be many references to
[the EPUB 3 specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/). The lower level APIs
exposed by this library require some knowledge of this specification. Here we
will cover the very basics necessary to work with the library, but we recommend
that users read through the linked specification to gain a deeper understanding
of the format.

### EPUB Basics

An EPUB file is a ZIP archive with a partially specified directory and file
structure. Most of the metadata and content is specified as XML documents, with
additional resources referenced from those XML documents.

The most important of these documents is the
[package document](https://www.w3.org/TR/epub-33/#sec-package-doc).

> The package document is an XML document that consists of a set of elements
> that each encapsulate information about a particular aspect of an EPUB
> publication. These elements serve to centralize metadata, detail the
> individual resources, and provide the reading order and other information
> necessary for its rendering.

This library is primary concerned with providing access to the metadata,
manifest, and spine of the EPUB publication. Metadata refers to information
_about_ the publication, such as its title or authors. The manifest refers to
the complete set of resources that are used to render the publication, such as
XHTML documents and image files. And the spine refers to the ordered list of
manifest items that represent the default reading order &mdash; the order that
readers will encounter the manifest items by simply turning pages one at a time.

### What this library does

`@smoores/epub` provides an API to interact with the metadata, manifest, and
spine of the EPUB publication. There are higher level APIs that mostly abstract
away the implementation details of the EPUB specification, like
`epub.setTitle(title: string)` and `epub.getCreators()`, as well as lower level
APIs like `epub.writeItemContents(path: string, contents: Uint8Array)` and
`epub.addMetadata(entry: MetadataEntry)`, which require some understanding of
the EPUB structure to utilize effectively.

Because EPUB publications rely heavily on the XML document format, this library
also provides utility methods for parsing, manipulating, and building XML
documents. The underlying XML operations are based on
[fast-xml-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fast-xml-parser).
